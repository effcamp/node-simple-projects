# node-simple-projects

All 3 projects are made with nodeJS as a learning experience. 

### Notetaker 
This is a simple node note taking app that makes a file to save the note information

### Weather-app
This uses a free weather api key to check the weather based on the location the user typed in the console.
It uses command line arguments and promises to get this done.

### Todo-api
This is a complete todo list api that has users and authentication with jwt and x-auth headers.
There is no front-end as of now, therefore all testing was done with postman. The backend is a locally hosted Mongo database.
It's hosted on Heroku and uses the mLab mongo plugin as a DB there.
This is a very complete api using many different expressJS features and also includes pretty extensive testing using Mocha.
